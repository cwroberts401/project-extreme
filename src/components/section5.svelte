    <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
    <h4>Turning Red?</h4>

        <p>Ed Durr stood before the audience in Shamong and issued a stark warning.</p>

<p>“They are coming for your kids,” he said.</p>

<p>The “they”? Democrats.</p>

<p>Durr, a former state senator, was referring to Gov. Phil Murphy’s <a href="https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-326.pdf">2023 executive order</a> allowing people of all ages access to transition surgery and hormone treatments.</p>

<p>“These little incremental things that they do with the age … they say we’re going to go to 16, then we’re going to go to 14, then we’re going to go to 10,” Durr said fiercely. “They want to do away with age. Why? We all know why.</p>

<p>“They’re grooming. That’s the bottom line.”</p>

<p>Durr knew his audience. He drove them to their feet.</p>

<p>He had been a feel-good story in South Jersey in 2021, spending just $2,500 to shock Sweeney, maybe the state’s most powerful politician and Democratic power broker this side of Murphy. But soon after, he was apologizing for previous social media messages, such as “A woman does have a choice! Keep her legs closed.” and "Mohammed was a pedophile! Islam is a false religion!”</p>

<p>Now he’s running for governor using fearmongering tactics. He did not respond to interview requests from NJ Advance Media.</p>

<p>“No state — and frankly, no nation — is immune to the scourge of extremism that has swept across the West in recent years," Murphy said in part in a statement. "However, it is appalling that some politicians in our state would choose to prey on these sentiments of hate and fear instead of upholding their responsibility to unite people around our shared identity — as New Jerseyans — as well as our shared values.”</p>

<p>But more far-right candidates like Durr might soon be coming to New Jersey, experts say.</p>

<p>The long-held county-line system — allowing party chairs to give candidates preferential placement on primary election ballots — is expected to be ruled unconstitutional after it was challenged in the 2023 Democratic Senate primary. Grassroots groups on the right and left view it as a victory for democracy, removing an enormous advantage fueled by favoritism and patronage.</p>

<p>But the state’s unique county-line system also keeps extreme candidates from gaining political power, according to Rasmussen, the Rebovich Institute director.</p>

<p>Many political observers now fear town and county organizations will be “taken over by left-wing extremists and right-wing extremists,” said James Santonastaso, a Democratic political operative in Sussex County.</p>

<p>“You mark my words, in two years, three years, four years, New Jersey will be dangerously close to going red in the Legislature because of the loss of the line,” he said.</p>

<p>But even now, figures like Durr and Crispi are far from isolated, fringe voices despite spouting hate.</p>

<p>Crispi has allies throughout the state like Auth, a conservative who avoids extremist rhetoric and sells himself as “promoting common sense voices in” New Jersey. Yet they appear together at events, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=814497954050625&set=pb.100064712833722.-2207520000">Auth is often</a> listed as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=543139348373831&set=a.108613791826391">member of the America First Republicans’ host committee.</a></p>

<p>Why would state and local leaders align themselves with figures like Crispi, Durr and Ingrassia?</p>

<p>“Right now (Crispi is) in communication with a segment of the Republican coalition,” Rasmussen said.</p>

<p>“And he's clearly got inroads within that community,” he added.</p>

<img alt="quote from ed durr" src={durrQuote}/>

<p>On the other side, Auth “must feel — and there's probably some evidence to support this — ‘My district is more conservative than most … I can put together a coalition with these folks,’” Rasmussen said.</p>

<p>Auth, who did not return messages seeking comment, is hardly alone.</p>

<p>Francisco, the Englishtown mayor, said speaking at the America First event in Keyport was not an endorsement of the hosts’ views.</p>

<p>“I did not elevate anything that anyone else said. I elevate what I say,” he said.</p>

<p>Although he disagrees with some of the rhetoric from Crispi and others — such as calling people “vermin” — Francisco downplayed their overall messaging, saying they did not call for violence.</p>

<p>Keyport Mayor Rose Araneo — who also spoke at the March event — said she “didn't even know who was going to be there.”</p>

<p>“I only knew the people that we were advised … so I was speaking on behalf of Keyport, stating that as a Republican, I support Trump,” she said. “I don't support all of these … as a Republican, I do support Trump. I support his ideas. Do I support a lot of these other people that were there? No.”</p>

<p>When Crispi heard Araneo’s comments, he called her “a RINO.”</p>

<p>Hudanish, the Alexandria Township committeeman, did not respond to emailed interview requests.</p>

<p>Santos is another politician walking a fine line: He claims to tune out the far right’s divisive messaging, yet embraces its support. The chair of the Union County Republican Party — a powerful position with influence over which candidates receive support — Santos welcomed endorsements from Ingrassia and others at a February fundraiser co-hosted by the America First Republicans of New Jersey.</p>

<p>“For me, a lot of that stuff I don't pay attention to,” Santos told NJ Advance Media about America First’s messaging. He added that he’s "all in on Trump,” but is not an “extreme MAGA guy” or a “conspiracy theory guy.”</p>

<p>NJ Advance Media attended two Santos events — one in February and another in April, when the Mountainside man appeared with Spadea. Santos didn’t spout conspiracy theories or white nationalist rhetoric. In fact, he appeared somewhat shy speaking before large crowds.</p>

<p>But Santos doesn’t want to allow inconvenient ties to those who support conspiracy theories or white nationalist views to get in the way of the coalitions he’s trying to build.</p>

<p>His goal is to forge a base in solidly blue Union County. He’s assembled fledgling support in Elizabeth and Linden where none existed and is growing others in Hillside, Rahway and Roselle, he says.</p>

<p>“I'm more worried about building the party, growing, winning elections on a local level and just giving Republicans a voice again, especially in the underserved Republican areas,” he said.</p>

<p>Even if it means aligning with purveyors of hate.</p>
