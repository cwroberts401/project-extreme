    <h3>Section 3</h3>
    <h4>Words = Violence</h4>
    <div>
        <p>The man wore a black face mask as he pulled in front of an Asbury Park church.</p>
        <p>He watched as a crowd of nearly 200 began heading home that night in January 2023 just as an anti-racism concert ended.</p>
        <p>But Nicholas Mucci didn’t want them to go. Not yet. He tried to block their exit with his Honda CR-V, authorities allege. Then he tossed two smoke bombs, filling the street in front of Trinity Episcopal Church with smoke, according to legal documents.</p>
        <p>“White lives matter, too,” he yelled before speeding away, authorities said.</p>
        <p>Mucci returned an hour later.</p>
        <p>The 28-year-old man raced out of the SUV and attempted to use bear spray on those still gathered in the church parking lot, according to officials.</p>
        <p>“White lives matter,” he yelled again before fleeing a second time, authorities contend.</p>
        <p>After an investigation, Mucci — an alleged white supremacist from Toms River — was arrested.</p>
        <p>Then a chilling discovery was made. When authorities searched his home, they found an unregistered AR-style assault weapon with a bump stock, a homemade bomb, and large-capacity ammunition magazines for a rifle and two handguns, according to court documents.</p>
        <p>And it turns out, law enforcement had already been looking for him. He was a suspect behind a racist banner recently hung over a highway as part of a white supremacist group. The banner hung over Route 22 in Bridgewater in March 2022???</p>
        <p>“It all started with this banner,” Tom Hauck, director of intelligence and operations at the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, told NJ Advance Media.</p>
        <p>It carried white supremacist messaging, he said before declining to go into further specifics.</p>
        <p>“They just started pulling threads,” Hauck said. “And fast forward, now we have this guy attacking the concert at a church, blocking people from leaving, throwing smoke and bear spray (then) to identifying him.”</p>
        <p>Mucci pleaded guilty to xxx and was sentenced in August to xxx. ,… said John Cito, Mucci’s attorney. He xxx … .</p>
        <p>Words have consequences, the incident proved. What begins with rhetoric can influence people and result in acts of violence. Especially in such tense, polarized times.</p>
        <p>The vitriol of influencers like Crispi especially troubles experts, who have witnessed messages of anger, paranoia and hate become mainstream discussion points even in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>In fact, some law enforcement officials and political experts say they’re fomenting rage and perhaps even future violence in a state home to more than 40 people arrested for their alleged roles in the Capitol riot.</p>
        <p>The America First movement calls on the U.S. to bar immigrants, promote “traditional” Christian values, and oppose liberal ideals such as feminism and LGBTQ+ rights, according to the Anti-Defamation League. After finding toeholds in states such as Michigan, Florida and Texas, it has found its way to the Garden State in growing numbers.</p>
        <p>Scapegoating people and amplifying conspiracies is nothing new in politics for either the right- or left-wing. But social media, internet forums, podcasts and even gaming platforms have become the new battlefield, where ultraconservative groups are fighting for hearts and minds (and votes) by spreading paranoia and anger. And their rhetoric may be more dangerous than ever, experts say, since hate speech and conspiracies have been mainstreamed, making them often sound like common political discourse.</p>
        <p>“The difficult thing about America First rhetoric is that … it was actually started really by Trump,” said Gia Kokotakis, an expert at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism.</p>
        <p>The threat experts fear most is a lone wolf attack, officials from the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security bluntly told NJ Advance Media. And they have good reason.</p>
        <p>The Buffalo supermarket shooter. The Pittsburgh synagogue shooter. The Charleston Black church shooter. The Trump shooter in Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, an anti-feminist attorney shot and killed the son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in 2020 at their home. Then three years later came the attack at the Asbury Park church.</p>
        <p>“We're really focused on the violence,” Neumann said. “We are concerned that the rhetoric and the tension in the country is still at all-time highs. And just based on past precedents, we do expect we are going to see violence this year.”</p>
        <p>It is New Jersey law enforcement’s biggest fear, something they told NJ Advance Media again and again in interviews.</p>
        <p>“There's been a shift from groups and organized attacks to lone offenders,” Hauck said. “Really the big concern is the lone offender.”</p>
        <p>While far-right influencers’ specific words might not call for violence, their rhetoric seeps into the ecosystem.</p>
        <p>“The threat is the network,” Lewis said. “It's these largely online spaces that obviously don't require state boundaries.”</p>
        <p>Because that network’s ideology could convince someone, possibly someone alienated, isolated or disenfranchised, to act whether they’re at a rally or just sitting on their couch.</p>
        <p>And overlapping rhetoric, say starting with Trump and reinforced in a local event or on social media, only raises the stakes. For instance, Soloway’s Shamong speech parroted xenophobic and racist rhetoric from Trump the same March weekend when the former president addressed similar themes in Ohio.</p>
        <p>“Everyone talks about these vermin — illegals who come in, get free health care, they deliver a baby as they're jumping across the border and they all become citizens,” Soloway said. “They get everything for free. You lose your insurance."</p>
        <p>“There’s rampant shootings, rapes, insane things,” he added.</p>
        <p>Other figures are more subtle.</p>
        <p>Spadea — a Princeton resident and an influential talk radio host on 101.5, one of the biggest political megaphones in the state — walked into an April event he hosted in Clark.</p>
        <p>He was greeted like a star by a crowd of 150 to 200. People rushed to have their photo taken with him. Spadea captivated the crowd, arguing that in New Jersey, there was little difference between establishment Democrats and establishment Republicans.</p>
        <p>“You feel burned, don’t you?” said Spadea, a man who once positioned himself as a moderate but in recent years has leaned into far-right messaging.</p>
        <p>Centrism has gotten New Jersey voters nowhere, he preached, another message often pushed by the America First Republicans, who persistently lash out at the hated RINOs.</p>
        <p>But a chilling response from an audience member that evening forced even Spadea to pivot, if ever so slightly.</p>
        <p>“Our jails are empty to the point where they’ve closed some of the county lockups,” Spadea said intensely. “You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna fill them back up.”</p>
        <p>The crowd applauded.</p>
        <p>Then a man in the audience shouted: “Put them in the ground!”</p>
        <p>“We don’t even have to do that,” Spadea retorted, regrouping quickly.</p>
        <p>But that’s as far as he would go to counter the man’s call for violence.</p>
