    <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
    <h4>Screaming in Digital</h4>
  </div>
    <div>
      <p>Influencers like Crispi and Spadea harness social media just like they work the room at live events, reaching larger audiences and maintaining continuous contact with the devout.</p>

      <p>Some hide behind dog whistle themes and coded language. Others spew outright venom, manipulating narratives such as immigration or culture war issues to lob verbal attacks at women, people of color, Jews and the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
      
      <p>“And then they take the next step and say, ‘We’ve got to do something,’” said Neumann, now chief strategy officer for Moonshot, a London-based tech company identifying online extremist threats.</p>
      
      <p>Influencers often roll out the same rhetoric in the digital realm as they do in their speeches. Migrants, the LGBTQ+ community and DEI efforts have been central themes among New Jersey’s far-right leaders.</p>
      
      <p>Spadea has used X to attack the trans community.</p>
      
      <p>“The trans cult has to be stopped. Trans women are MEN. The court doesn’t need to decide on the definition of a woman,” he wrote in 2023. “It’s self evident. It’s biology. It’s reality. Stop the assault on women. It’s common sense.”</p>
      
      <img src={image1}>
      
      <p>Spadea has also used the platform to support those implicated in the Jan. 6 riot.</p>
      
      <p>“Ridiculous. Every thinking, honest person knows that this was nothing even close to an insurrection. Jan 6th is a Leftist lie,” Spadea tweeted in 2021.</p>
      
      <p>Spadea did not respond to a text message requesting an interview. His campaign manager requested potential interview questions, but did not follow up once they were provided.</p>
      
      <p>Ingrassia uses his <a href="https://paulingrassia.substack.com/p/how-trump-can-win-new-jersey-new?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2">Substack</a> to push ideas promoted by the white nationalism movement, including that schools are indoctrinating “the hatred of whites,” he said in one of his essays.</p>
      
      <p><a href="https://paulingrassia.substack.com/p/how-trump-can-win-new-jersey-new?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2">“As they do this to the native population,”</a> he writes, “they are replacing us with migrants from not only Mexico, or even Latin America, but all over the world.”</p>
      
      <p>Ingrassia did not respond to interview requests.</p>
      
      <p>Stouffer and her <a href="https://newjerseyproject.org/">New Jersey Project</a>, a group “protecting childhood for our children” against “tyranny … by the state,” started with a parents’ rights Facebook group, NJ Schools.</p>
      
      <p>The group has advocated for banning certain school library books — often involving LGBTQ+ themes. Stouffer has publicly said she’s not opposed to gay rights or the LGBTQ+ community, yet has <a href="https://substack.com/@mathgoddess/p-138009628">likened being transgender to mental illness</a> on her Substack.</p>
      
      <p>She has also hosted several events with Mack, and the New Jersey Project co-hosted the Shamong event in which pro-LGBTQ+ and trans policies were demonized.</p>
      
      <p>Stouffer, in an emailed response to an interview request, said she doesn’t “personally know anyone who fits” the description of political extremism, “so I'm not sure how much help I can be.”</p>
      
      <p>“The only authoritarian measures I can think of were imposed by the NJEA through Governor (Phil) Murphy in 2020, 2021, and 2022 onto our children…” she wrote in part. “The kids are not OK after the extremism that impacted them for three school years…”</p>
      
      <p>Yet Stouffer at times has aligned herself with Mack — who defended the conspiratorial, antisemitic and pro-Russian propaganda material on his site in an interview. Then he diverted the discussion to address Khazarian Jews, who he says essentially run the world.</p>
      
      <p>“If you look up and see where all the money is coming from and who's paying all the news outlets. I mean, have you done your homework on that?” Mack said. “Who pays for all the major news outlets in the entire world? …</p>
      
      <p>“They speak for a vast majority of the banking systems in the world, and a vast majority of the media in the world.”</p>
      
      <img alt="quote" src={spadeaQuote}/>
      
      <p>There’s a correlation between threatening antisemitic, anti-Black and anti-migrant language online and an increase in hate crimes against those groups, according to Moonshot, which compared internet trends in 2022 with FBI hate crime data.</p>
      
      <p>“We do have increasing evidence that shows that what happens online doesn't stay online,” Neumann said.</p>
      
      <p>That’s especially concerning when influencers like <a href="https://omny.fm/shows/mike-crispi-unafraid/the-great-replacement-is-real-and-in-overdrive">Crispi call out minority groups</a>, such as when he labeled <a href="https://rumble.com/v4nluer--mike-crispi-unafraid-4.5.24-10am-est.html">migrants “vermin”</a> on his show.</p>
      
      <p>“We see this by the way they commit violent crime. We see this by the way they riot at the border,” he said.</p>
      
      <p>The transgender community was in his sights in a March 2023 episode, <a href="https://omny.fm/shows/mike-crispi-unafraid/ban-the-trans-abolish-pronouns-protect-christians">“Ban The Trans, Abolish Pronouns, Protect Christians.”</a></p>
      
      <p>He began the show saying: “Hello everybody. I am Mike Crispi, and I am calling for a complete and total ban of transgenders until we figure out what the hell is going on in our country. Period. Full stop.”</p>
      
      <p>In multiple interviews with NJ Advance Media, Crispi portrayed himself as an “authentic” straight-talker whose tone matches that of his “violent” and vicious” foes — “the socialists and communists” of the Democratic Party.</p>
      
      <p>“I don't think my language is inflammatory,” he said. “I think it's common sense.”</p>
      
      <p>Crispi says the left is “enabling pedophilia” and “showing first graders porn in school books,” referring to New Jersey’s sex education curriculum and LGBTQ+-themed library books.</p>
      
      <p>He defended his use of demeaning and bigoted language — such as labeling migrants “vermin” — and conspiracy theories.</p>
      
      <p>“When I say vermin, I mean people who come into this country, they say they're seeking asylum, they bastardize the process,” he said. “They come in, they get their debit cards, they commit crime on the streets, they make it an unsafe living environment. ... I think that anybody would agree that's vermin.”</p>
      
      <p>He then made a distinction between the “vermin” and “good” immigrants, people “seeking asylum and … fleeing oppression” — a distinction he rarely makes in his speeches or on his shows.</p>
      
      <p>Regardless, Crispi views anyone not supporting Trump — especially other Republicans — as adversaries.</p>
      
      <p>“If you are not fully with President Trump, (against) what Kamala Harris is pushing … you're our enemy, because this is the last stand of the most important election of our lifetime.”</p>
