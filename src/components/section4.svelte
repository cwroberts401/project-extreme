    <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
    <h4>Screaming in Digital</h4>

        <p>Gatherings are for the converted. But social media, Internet forums, podcasts and livestreams are the vehicles to reach new audiences and maintain continuous contact with the devout.</p>
        <p>In the past, most political radicalization occurred through direct, in-person contact. Meetings. A handshake and a pamphlet. Or maybe introducing a friend of a friend. But these days, it happens digitally, according to Neumann, the former Homeland Security assistant secretary for counterterrorism and threat prevention.</p>
        <p>“That's how you network with people,” she said.</p>
        <img src={image1}>
        <p>Live streaming service Twitch, video sharing site Rumble and instant messaging apps Telegram and Discord are popular platforms to spread ultraconservative messaging. They are especially used to target young people, as are many gaming chat functions, according to experts. Facebook and Gab, a social networking service, are also popular among the right.</p>
        <p>Their messaging often involves attacks on “others,” our investigation found: People of color. Jews. The trans community. Scapegoats worked for Nazi Germany and Muslim fundamentalists. It remains a powerful tool in New Jersey in 2024, experts say.</p>
        <p>Moonshot, the company identifying extremist threats and offering support services, conducted research comparing online trends in 2022 with FBI hate crime data. It found a correlation between threatening antisemitic, anti-Black and anti-migrant language and an increase in hate crimes against those groups. Whether the connection is causal is unknown.</p>
        <p>“We do have increasing evidence that shows that what happens online doesn't stay online,” Neumann said.</p>
        <p>Stouffer and her New Jersey Project, a union of parents “protecting childhood for our children” against “tyranny … by the state,” started with a parents’ rights Facebook group, NJ Schools. It has xxx14,400xxx members, coalescing the wave of anger and dissatisfaction with New Jersey schools during the pandemic.</p>
        <p>The group has advocated for the removal of school library books and pushed for parental notification when students request transgender accommodations. Stouffer has said publicly that she’s not opposed to gay rights or the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
        <p>But she’s hosted several events with Mack. New Jersey Project co-hosted the Shamong event in which Durr said Democrats are “grooming” children through LGBTQ+ and trans policies. And New Jersey Project’s Facebook page is filled with anti-LGBTQ+ posts.</p>
        <p>Spadea has used X to attack the trans community.</p>
        <p>“The trans cult has to be stopped. Trans women are MEN. The court doesn’t need to decide on the definition of a woman,” he wrote in 2023. “It’s self evident. It’s biology. It’s reality. Stop the assault on women. It’s common sense.”</p>
        <p>Spadea has also used the platform to support those implicated in the Jan. 6 riot, calling it “clearly nothing even close to “insurrection.”</p>

        <p>“Ridiculous. Every thinking, honest person knows that this was nothing even close to an insurrection. Jan 6th is a Leftist lie,” Spadea tweeted in 2021.</p>
        <p>Others are trying to rechristen Capitol rioters as “political prisoners,” “patriots” and “hostages,” painting the federal government much like Timothy McVeigh did to justify the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.</p>
        <p>Ingrassia uses his Substack to push ideas promoted by the white nationalism movement, including that schools are indoctrinating “the hatred of whites,” he said in one of his pieces.</p>
        <p>“As they do this to the native population,” he writes, “they are replacing us with migrants from not only Mexico, or even Latin America, but all over the world.”</p>
        <p>And Crispi has used his podcast to take on immigration, calling migrants “vermin.”</p>
        <p>“We see this by the way they commit violent crime. We see this by the way they riot at the border. We see this by the way they go knock over city council meetings and go crazy and riot and protest for more stuff,” he said. “We see this by the street gangs that they’re forming on the streets, and debit cards that they’re getting in New York City.”</p>
        <p>Transgender people were in his sights in a March 2023 episode, “Ban The Trans, Abolish Pronouns, Protect Christians.”</p>
        <p>He began the show saying: “Hello everybody. I am Mike Crispi, and I am calling for a complete and total ban of transgenders until we figure out what the hell is going on in our country. Period. Full stop.”</p>
        <p>In April, “Mike Crispi Unafraid” took on “The Great Replacement Is Real And In Overdrive.” The replacement he was referring to? The theory that the white population is being systematically replaced by people of color in a grand conspiracy operated by those in power.</p>
        <p>“There’s discrimination against whites at this point in many aspects,” Crispi said in the episode.</p>
